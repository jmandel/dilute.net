<h2>Poems and Paragraphs</h2>
Josh Mandel
<br><h3>1. There is little margin</h3> 
	There is little margin for blaming circumstance. If there was ever a feeling of momentum, of drifting windswept through the waters of change, this was nothing more than illusory. At every bifurcation has lain a kernel of choice. After all, of course, the decision to drift is itself a manifestation of will. <br />
<br />
There is little, then, to blame if I find myself three months into this expedition with parched lips and an empty canteen. And there are only so many times one can lift the depleted supply to one's lips and still recognize with some degree of surprise that nothing remains. <br />
<br />
I am tired of doling out emotions in one-hundred-word fragments. But then sometimes I wonder whether I emote at all. At what depths does a momentary wave of sadness reverberate? And the nostalgia that looms, seems to pervade my nights and loneliness: how far does it penetrate?<br />
<br />
<hr><br><h3>4. Down the dirt path </h3> 
	Down the dirt path to the Little League diamond behind the convenience store, sitting in the grass and alerted by the nearly imperceptible weight of a red ant on my wrist, for the first I noticed that period (extended to the limits of its viability on these summer nights) between sunset and darkness. For the first time I was alert to that interval where shadows reign but darkness waits at bay, the air cold but still glowing with the last embers of sunlight. It is the end result of an evening&#146;s exercise in slowly lengthening shadows, final culmination of darkness stretching like fingertips over the landscape, that time when shadows have gotten so long that even a distant mountain, or a hill, or a tree, or even a blade of grass casts an image long enough to reach the horizon. When the light hits you at such an extreme angle (rays perfectly perpendicular) and you sit entranced by the entrance of night, you can almost feel (though never for long) that ultimate tension, battle terrifying to contemplate (for which of us could serve two masters?)  the pronounced juxtaposition of infinities.<hr><br><h3>5. It lettered last night</h3> 
	It lettered last night, words of commendation drifting in lattices, descending windswept over a frozen river of mediocracy as I lay still as blue, a heap of crisp lines and no trace of a blur. They piled up, those compliments, so many words of praise just barely resting on the surface as though the tension of the water itself were enough to support them. Light like down, but heavy too as only feathers are so many syllables rang out for those more special than I. It was yet be fore dawn, and there was a line formed by the chosen few. They were accepting graciously, noddin g and smiling only slightly as they glided across the frozen surface, whole bodies seeming to fl oat like the words in which they basked.<br />
<br />
There was glitter from sunlight, patterns and networks of refractions glistening, an interplay o f sparkles that danced off of symmetrical flakes as rocking they descended.<br />
<br />
And then it was something strange. An invisible current, and maddeningly narrow grabbed just one flake by its edge and diverted it up, that solitary fragment alone adrift against so many other s. It struck me, then, and stung because I had pulled all stops in that doomed race: even that o ne flake, the fluke that flew not down but up, even the last trace of hope reflected from that s ingle source was not directed at me. Indeed from my window view it was no better than the far-of f dawn, all vague and smothered in haze.<br />
<hr><br><h3>6. We were stuck</h3> 
	We were stuck there,<br />
conversation crammed in a dead-end,<br />
waiting for a "but"<br />
that would never come.<br />
<br />
She was waiting for me to<br />
make sense of myself,<br />
to justify actions,<br />
explain them, at least,<br />
or take them back.<br />
<br />
I could not give her this,<br />
could not ever satisfy,<br />
(never sufficiently)<br />
the depths of that misery,<br />
the immensity of it,<br />
the way everything was suddenly consumed<br />
in tears and anger and<br />
exasperated words.<br />
<br />
We were just stuck,<br />
feelings failing to move forward,<br />
so many sentiments just frozen in place,<br />
a mere silhouette illuminated by the<br />
embers of what must once have been a blaze.<br />
<br />
We were stuck,<br />
midconversation<br />
(or was it end-of-the-line ?)<br />
half way through a phrase<br />
and waiting for a "but"<br />
that could never come.<hr><br><h3>7. I don't have time</h3> 
	I don't have time for device.<br />
Nothing fancy, no shadow-play<br />
or allusion to make<br />
by way of coming to a point.<br />
There's no caution to heed -<br />
no need, at this point,<br />
to play by the rules.<br />
Because it's empty,<br />
the promise I made that day:<br />
You remember the one<br />
(the one I've forgotten -<br />
the one about us, and always.<br />
It was the one where I was sincere<br />
and you were sincere<br />
and we looked at each other.<br />
I gazed more or less deeply<br />
into your eyes<br />
and I said something<br />
I can barely recall).<br />
It's like a balloon, though,<br />
or a kite by now -<br />
the wind gusting<br />
over hills,<br />
stirring up old feelings,<br />
mixing misery with dirt,<br />
strings stretched taut,<br />
aching to be free.<hr><br><h3>8. It's cruel</h3> 
	It's cruel,<br />
how small our windows are:<br />
the pipes through which we breathe,<br />
mufflers that dampen and leave words<br />
intonationless,<br />
sentiments expressed in the<br />
frigid vacancy of a hollow voice,<br />
or a twenty-six character world.<br />
And there we are,<br />
stretching media,<br />
fingertips just glancing,<br />
only a memory of warmth<br />
conjured up across the void.<br />
And the suffocating stars,<br />
one by one extinguished<br />
in the thinness of it all,<br />
call me back to the fact<br />
of impending sorrow -<br />
of the way decisions<br />
have traveled, followed me,<br />
grabbing hold, somehow,<br />
despite the vacuum.<br />
But it's hard to look around,<br />
senses straining to strip off the noise,<br />
head cocked and hypersensitive,<br />
jumping at the least provocation.<br />
It's disconcerting, flailing in a state like this.<br />
I'm taking things as they come.<hr><br><h3>9. With all the ink spent</h3> 
	With all the ink spent,<br />
with all the industry and affection that<br />
poured three years into the undertaking,<br />
with the sheer number of words uttered,<br />
the silences that ensued were that much more pronounced,<br />
explicit, impossible to bear.<br />
<br />
Because after all, it was a great achievement indeed.<br />
It was colossal, something astronomical,<br />
but subtle, too -- a set of secrets shared,<br />
ideas entangled one's with the other's to such an extent<br />
that remembering what was whose at the end became a game<br />
of guessing.<br />
<br />
The very fabric that was woven (torn apart), the sets of<br />
beliefs and jokes, bedside silliness and curiosity,<br />
the months apart -- those long months --<br />
<br />
all of it, accumulated, tallied...<br />
and would you believe it: even-up at three years' end.<br />
<br />
The House took it back,<br />
bet diligently on certainties,<br />
the obvious: fear, jealousy, desire.<br />
<br />
Yes, in the end that consistency alone paid off: those affirmations<br />
and compliments, the complements of one against the other...<br />
<br />
all of it, enveloped into something<br />
apathetic, or worse.<br />
<br />
all of it shadowed,<br />
swallowed up in five aching hours.<hr><br><h3>10. You called, I remember</h3> 
	You called, I remember,<br />
But after the garbled transmission<br />
and the still-wafting haze<br />
your words never reached me.<br />
I recall your tone, though,<br />
the way you sounded,<br />
despite the haze, and the bad reception -<br />
I remember the silences that punctuated<br />
So many of your thoughts,<br />
The way the technology imposed absolute silence<br />
until the threshold was met.<br />
There was no hearing you breathe,<br />
no listening to myself think<br />
through all that delayed motion,<br />
the echos still rattling,<br />
and nothing but the sound of your voice<br />
getting through.<br />
I tried for a while to acknowledge you:<br />
I made an effort at affirming our communication.<br />
But after a while of drifting,<br />
after being transported out of my own thoughts and<br />
back beyond what anyone could remember<br />
(indeed back to a time primeval and eerily quiet-<br />
but never silent)<br />
but after a while there was only the tone of your voice,<br />
and while it never lulled,<br />
I still fell asleep.<br />
<hr><br><h3>11. I remember distinctly </h3> 
	I remember distinctly what I thought of you before we met.<br />
The potential, the hard-packed pluripotency,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	the excitement of the open road ahead --<br />
there was hardly a hint then of the trauma, <br />
the fabricated convictions, the abruptly-adopted<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		hobbies and preferences and my own slipping away, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		losing ground to the steady crank of incidental transformation. <br />
<br />
I couldn't have predicted the way I'd detach, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		compassion, enthusiasm, tenderness all falling<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		off the bone like so much overcooked meat. <br />
I might have shuddered to think of how little substance would remain. <br />
<br />
But that carcass, the loosely-hinged skeleton<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		that persists through the lies and false promises,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;		survives the idiotic obsessions: <br />
It's hard to explain, but hope crops up in the most unlikely places. <hr><br><h3>13. Saturday in a Basement Engineering Library</h3> 
	Books<br />
are stacked<br />
everywhere<br />
packed tight up an aisle<br />
whose narrow rows could zip shut<br />
with the careless operation of a crank<br />
I can see myself stuck between two stacks of journals<br />
crushed packed paper-thin into another victim of compact shelving.<br />
<br />
Whose<br />
childhood<br />
dream was to<br />
track uric acid<br />
in weevil-infested wheat<br />
derive a differential equation to<br />
govern the machines that squirt fig into fig newton<br />
bury another tedious engineering career in the stacks?<hr><br><h3>14. Metric Spot Check</h3> 
	I have a natural phrase,<br />
iambic trimeter<br />
that isn't lonely like<br />
the sound my heartbeat makes<br />
recovering from New York:<br />
the rows of screens and brains<br />
and tag-team interviews<br />
that left me pressed and bland<br />
as any business suit.<br />
<br />
I haven't eaten lunch<br />
and I could spare an hour<br />
to stare and wander through<br />
Times Square, but I decide<br />
to hail another cab,<br />
my third since five a.m.,<br />
and catch an early flight.<hr><br><h3>15. Edge Effects</h3> 
	I meant to write about the neon crowd<br />
around Times Square on any Friday night<br />
but someone beat me to the game: it might<br />
have been the guy in line behind me for<br />
the urinal at intermission, but<br />
laconic custom holds it impolite<br />
to speak in mens' rooms, so I didn't ask.<br />
In either case, the poem isn't mine.<br />
<br />
But if I might indulge one sidewalk scene:<br />
a raving maniac with bible propped<br />
to doomsday prophesies -- he points at me<br />
and screeches ``a Professor of College!'' as<br />
the crowd, constricting, edges out beyond<br />
his raven-hemmed perimeter of speech.<br />
<hr><br><h3>16. The AD558 Restricted to Blank Verse</h3> 
	The Analog Devices dacport is<br />
a low-cost digital to analog<br />
converter with an eight-bit input port.<br />
It's microprocessor compatible<br />
and guaranteed to operate with less<br />
than half a bit of error for a range<br />
of temperature near twenty-five degrees.<br />
The power dissipation won't exceed<br />
five-hundred milliwatts for high supplies<br />
of less than twenty volts, and settle-time<br />
for output is a microsecond, so<br />
it's suitable for use at frequencies<br />
below a megahertz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circuit fits<br />
within a single monolithic chip.<hr><br><h3>17. Pantoum for Pesach</h3> 
	There's a no man's land in central Mass.<br />
where neither NPR affiliate<br />
I listen to is audible: I pass<br />
in static through the bulk of it.<br />
<br />
Without an NPR affiliate<br />
I'm drowsy, and I count the time<br />
with static, just to make the most of it.<br />
Sometimes I wish my home were mine.<br />
<br />
But drowsy, when I count the time<br />
to dinner I remember being eight<br />
and wishing grandma's home were mine<br />
at Pesach, drinking wine and eating late.<br />
<br />
One seder, I remember being eight.<br />
My brother drank a grown-up's cup<br />
of Pesach wine, got sick, and eating late<br />
was not entrancing as I'd hoped.<br />
<br />
My brother drinks a grown-up's cup<br />
today without a second thought --<br />
but alcohol is not entrancing as I'd hoped<br />
from all the lessons I was taught.<br />
<br />
This evening not a single thought<br />
of mine is audible. I pass<br />
ignoring lessons I've been taught.<br />
There's a no man's land in western Mass.<hr><br><h3>18. Villanelle, Almost Audible</h3> 
	Within a crowd I feel the most alone:<br />
while other more ebullient voices gush,<br />
my silence masks an awkward undertone.<br />
<br />
On kindergarten bus rides I was one<br />
to feign unconsciousness in callow hush:<br />
within a crowd I feel the most alone.<br />
<br />
I'd hide inside a cardboard box and hone<br />
my ears on conversation's inrush:<br />
my silence masks an awkward undertone.<br />
<br />
Or middle school: at dances I was prone<br />
to hide backstage, avoid my sixth grade crush:<br />
within a crowd I feel the most alone.<br />
<br />
And even now, with friends or on the phone<br />
communication takes another push:<br />
my silence masks an awkward undertone.<br />
<br />
Disquieted, I fear I've never grown<br />
accustomed to the blooming boundless rush.<br />
Within a crowd I feel the most alone.<br />
My silence masks an awkward undertone.<hr><br><h3>19. Blurred Moon</h3> 
	We went camping once when it was cold enough<br />
to see your breath misting the stars<br />
and I knew you well enough to hike into the woods<br />
singing with a pot on my head<br />
and liked you just enough to be jealous when you<br />
laughed with Jessica instead of me.<br />
I used you as a tripod: my rudimentary lunar<br />
photograph left the moon a blur<br />
and your hair entangled in the camera strap.<br />
We had watched the sun set and the moon rise<br />
before we noticed how dark it got<br />
and slipped half scared in thrill down the slick trail to camp.<br />
Then something left me juvenile in twig-snapping blackness,<br />
drove me out of my sleeping bag<br />
and into a little clearing to listen to your conversation<br />
and try to frighten you with the eeriest leaf-rustling I could muster.<br />
In the morning I awoke, rolled down the hill<br />
from where I'd lain and fussed, embarrassed --<br />
but you, already packed, wouldn't hear my apology.<hr><br><h3>20. The Potential of Maple</h3> 
	We made enough smoke<br />
in the kitchen<br />
to crowd out the pluming tension<br />
with burned bits of pancake<br />
caked dry on cast iron<br />
never quite cured,<br />
pluming wisps that mounted<br />
as if handsome decoration<br />
artfully diffusing foyer light,<br />
as if to be displayed<br />
next to a stolen hotel bathrobe<br />
and the towel with my name<br />
sewn in near the corner<br />
from summer camp.<br />
<br />
If I'd had my way<br />
we would have eaten at that<br />
restaurant with picnic tables<br />
and plastic cloths<br />
and the petting zoo just outside the dining room<br />
where for a quarter you could buy a handful<br />
of animal feed from a candy machine<br />
and let the sheep gobble it up,<br />
the kind of place that's only open<br />
two months a year<br />
when the sap's flowing<br />
and the stove's burning<br />
with the subtle-sweet scent of maple<br />
just shimmering in the air,<br />
and you can order a stack of pancakes<br />
big enough to pop your pants' top button.<br />
You would have been a smash hit<br />
at the placemat anagram contest,<br />
could have probably found a hundred words<br />
in maple syrup,<br />
beaten my grandparents' score<br />
of seventy-eight and been<br />
immortalized with a thumbtack above the cash register<br />
where people wonder what's the difference<br />
between fancy and medium grade,<br />
and what about maple sugar, and<br />
maple butter, and how many words could be<br />
hiding, jumbled in a simple phrase.<hr><br><h3>21. The shampoo-sweat</h3> 
	The shampoo-sweat of your scalp is enough<br />
to turn me snuff-taker,<br />
nostrils tucked<br />
under dirty-blond locks<br />
to draw in euphoria.<br />
You're dozing;  I'm electrified.<br />
<br />
And both our spines supported<br />
by an orthopedic innerspring of solid steel.<br />
We're twisted in a net of jersey-knit,<br />
goose-down, egg-foam, pre-compressed fibers,<br />
duvet.  Touche!<br />
<br />
And isn't it luxurious these days,<br />
with eighty inches of Unicased mattress comfort<br />
to explore that little space at the base<br />
of your neck, the smooth parts<br />
by your belly button,<br />
dimples, earlobes,<br />
fingernails, tooth marks.<br />
<br />
The shock-absorbing box spring<br />
barely flutters but<br />
your eyelids open; mine close.<br />
I'm feigning sleep.<br />
<hr><br><h3>22. Ad-verse</h3> 
	Escorted Europe Tours<br />
at discount prices<br />
are enticing,<br />
like the concert tickets,<br />
wonka bars,<br />
and kitchen sinks<br />
that Google's pushing right<br />
beside my e-mail.<br />
<br />
Thank heaven for the Internet!<br />
<br />
I mean, they really tried<br />
to offer me a kitchen sink,<br />
complete with "experts" to advise me<br />
on my "kitchen sinks needs."<br />
<br />
Now I'm an ignoramous<br />
when it comes to plumbing,<br />
but I'm pretty sure<br />
this "HandyHome Guide"<br />
won't address my needs.<br />
<br />
The page consists of <br />
a list of ads<br />
above a list of ads<br />
below a little graphic<br />
of a house.<br />
And at bottom, naturally,<br />
it's copyright<br />
two thousand five, all rights reserved.<br />
<br />
Last night a server somewhere<br />
on the information superhighway<br />
entertained the notion that<br />
I might enjoy a pair of<br />
inline skates,<br />
with "free fast shipping"<br />
and "effective breaks" ---<br />
"exactly what I need."<br />
I'm hazerdous enough at<br />
low velocity!<br />
<br />
But sometimes it occurs to me<br />
that Google's right,<br />
perhaps they know me better<br />
than I know myself with thirteen thousand<br />
e-mails logged and analyzed.<br />
Perhaps their urgings are astute:<br />
<br />
'Cause I can almost see myself,<br />
lug wrench in hand,<br />
or whatever kind of wrench you use<br />
to fix a sink (I'm sure the experts<br />
know.) and chowing on a wonka bar,<br />
anticipating Europe as I skate<br />
my way across the kitchen floor.<hr><br><h3>23. Swiss Miss </h3> 
	We're shaving chocolate bars in<br />
shaggy heaps, stirring to dissolve<br />
the flecks with a teaspoonful<br />
of sugar, pinch of salt,<br />
two drops' vanilla extract<br />
and a final minute at <br />
the resonant frequency<br />
of milk.<br />
<br />
We could have used the stove,<br />
lit matches and methane<br />
and burned off the scary-sulfur<br />
mercaptan smell at 11,000 btu per hour ---<br />
<br />
But where's the fun of foamy<br />
milk film stuck to the sides<br />
of a pot?  What's the point of<br />
sponging down the metal<br />
in a hot sink when slick Pyrex<br />
and silicone rinse clean<br />
in seconds?<br />
<br />
And then again, why bother<br />
scraping bittersweet bars<br />
across the grater stroke<br />
by stroke, the chocolate dust<br />
melting on our hands?<br />
There's the cutting board<br />
to clean, the sharp box grater<br />
that gets clogged<br />
and awkward in the sink,<br />
and all that work for<br />
sixteen ounces of hot cocoa.<br />
<hr><br><h3>24. Apoptosis and Necrosis</h3> 
	Already halfway through my coffee,<br />
hardly fifteen minutes through the nine a.m.<br />
I start to wonder how I'll go.<br />
<br />
A cellular biologist divides the modes of death<br />
in two broad categories: apoptosis and necrosis.<br />
Like any good taxonomy the archetypes<br />
are polar opposites.<br />
<br />
Some say that for destruction apoptosis<br />
has its charm, control, a regulated<br />
inward shrinkage timed to signals<br />
from the outside world,<br />
disintegration bleb by bleb until no core remains:<br />
a quiet death and easily absorbed into the sea<br />
of nameless neighbors,<br />
one more empty seat in lecture hall<br />
consumed by someone's sweater,<br />
desk usurped for coffee, cell phone<br />
or banana peel.<br />
<br />
But I can feel myself taking the other path,<br />
with undissected head and neck still<br />
glaring down in grave indifference<br />
there are some necrotic signs, the swelling<br />
thoughts and captivating whisper<br />
of freedom swirling through my studies.<br />
<br />
So there's this swelling plus a kind of<br />
leakiness, disregulated planning and spending<br />
as I ditch the textbooks to bake gleaming sheets<br />
of hypertrophic chocolate chip cookies.<br />
I purchase cookbooks on the Internet<br />
and stoneware at department stores<br />
and daydream of a future where I'll have<br />
the time to use them ---<br />
<br />
All early signs, reversible.<br />
<br />
And yet from what I've learned to date<br />
as salt pours in and water follows by osmosis,<br />
every membrane meets its fate,<br />
the mute explosions of necrosis.<br />
